Whishlist (by BigWhale) and reasons why is something still on a whishlist

 - Global keyboard shortcuts
   Disappeared when going from Gtk2 to Gtk3. Why? Python-keybinder was used
   in previous version. Keybinder still isn't ported to Gtk3, so, no keys.

   Alternatives:
     - Do it the same way as keybinder. Can't. gdk_window_add_filter() isn't
       an introspectable function, someone has to rewrite it.

     - Use Xlib. Can't. Xlib needs to be in another thread.
       Gtk3 + pygst + Xlib = Weird clusterfsck that will seg fault python.

- Frame marking the capture area while recording is in progress
  A transparent window with no input mask is required on screen. However,
  for that to work, Gdk.cairo_region_create_from_surface() is required. For
  some reason, this fuction still isn't introspected. See:
