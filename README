           Kazam v1.3.4 "NCC-2893"


Introduction
------------

Kazam is a simple screen recording program that will capture the content
of your screen and record a video file that can be played by any video
player that supports VP8/WebM video format.

Optionally you can record sound from any sound input device that is
supported and visible by PulseAudio.


Latest version
--------------

Kazam is always available from Launchpad under https://launchpad.net/kazam

Latest stable release is 1.0.6.
Latest unstable release is 1.3.1 - Stargazer edition


Installation - stable release
-----------------------------

If you are using Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 then stable version (1.0.x)
is available from universe repository. You can find it in Ubuntu Softare
Center or install it from the terminal with the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install kazam

For Ubuntu 11.10 - Oneiric Ocelot, the best way to install Kazam is to add
a PPA repository and then use apt-get command or Software Centre.

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kazam-team/stable-series
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install kazam

For distribution independent installation you will have to get the latest
tarball release from Launchpad:

http://launchpad.net/kazam/stable/1.0.6/+download/kazam_1.0.6.tar.gz

Unpack it and then run setup:

   $ tar -xzf kazam_1.0.6.tar.gz
   $ cd kazam-1.0.6

Run installation as root user, or use sudo:

   # python setup.py install


Installation - development version
----------------------------------

If you want bleeding edge, development version then you will have to get
source code from Launchpad by running the following command:

   $ bzr branch lp:kazam

Then you need to run setup.py to build and install Kazam:

   $ cd kazam
   # python setup.py install

You will have to run setup as root user or use sudo. Default installation
path is /usr/local.


Running Kazam
-------------

If you want to run Kazam from the source tree, there are a few limitations
that you have to take into account. Right now Ubuntu App indicator will not
allow setting custom icons. Every icon has to be taken from currently
installed icon theme. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/kazam/+bug/657857 for
more information.

To run Kazam simply execute te following commands in the source tree:

$ cd bin
$ ./kazam

If you already have Kazam installed then Kazam icon will show in the
indicator, if not, the only way to get to the menu is to click on one
of the icons in the indicator and then move around with the cursor keys.

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

SUPER-CTRL-Q - Quit
SUPER-CTRL-W - Show/Hide main window
SUPER-CTRL-R - Start Recording
SUPER-CTRL-F - Finish Recording

Keyboard shortcuts will work if you installed Kazam 1.3.x from a PPA,
keybinder 3.0 is now a dependency and will be installed automatically.

From Ubuntu 12.10 keyboard binder is available in the universe repositories.


Known Issues
------------

- Support for multiple monitors is there, but your mileage may vary. It
was tested only on two screen setup where both screens are side by side. With
Region recording the Video source is ignored.

- Trouble with recording from certain Monitor sources. I noticed this with
Logitech G110 USB Keyboard that can play audio. Pulse Audio will see two
devices: USP PnP Stereo Device and Monitor of USB PnP Stereo Device. When
recording from the monitor, volume controls for both devices will affect
the volume in the final recording.

- I have no idea where to put Mute/Unmute button, so right now every audio
source you select is automatically unmuted.

- It was reported that sound is disappearing after couple of minutes into
the recording. I wasn't able to reproduce this bug and any more info is
appreciated. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/kazam/+bug/933835 for more
details.

Recording Tips
--------------

Framerates above 20fps are unlikely to work well because of software and
hardware limitations. If you increase framerate and framerate in
resulting video drops, that is because encoder can't keep up.

Always do a sound check. Especially if you are recording a live commentary
with background sound. I got the best results when I used earphones to listen
to the audio while recording. This way your mic will not pick up any audio
coming from speakers.


Debugging & reporting problems
------------------------------

If you encounter a bug or any kind of unexpected behavior please try to
reproduce it while you run Kazam from standard terminal with --debug option.
Use Launchpad to report bugs (https://bugs.launchpad.net/kazam/+filebug) and
include generated output.
